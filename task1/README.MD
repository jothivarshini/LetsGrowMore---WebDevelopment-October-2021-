# Creating a single page website 

This task is to determine the understanding  of HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

A template regarding the layout of the page was provided. The objective is to replicate the layout with customized designing. 

How to run the file:
In the images file, all images that have been used in the site have been given. The mainpage and styles are separate files in the repository. For understanding purposes, they are placed separately in this repository. Make sure that your images and html(as well as css files) are in the same folder, else you won't be able to access the images of the site.
